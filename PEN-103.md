## Fundamental Linux

### Introduction
Linux is the operating system kernel, which is started by the boot loader, which is itself started by the BIOS/UEFI.
BIOS/UEFI -> boot loader -> OS kernel

**The User Space** which we use this for lumping together everything that happens outside of the kernel.

### Driving Hardware
- **/proc/ and /sys/** are virtua file systems that kernel exports data about detected hardware.
-  **dev/** is that applications often access devices by way of files crated within.
-  **/dev/sda is disk drives**, **/dev/sda1 is partitions**, **mouse is /dev/input/mouse0**, **keyboards is /dev/input/event0**, **sound cards is /dev/snd/***, **serial ports is /dev/ttyS**
- There are two types of device files: **block and character**.
- Block type has characteristics of a block of data: **It has a finite size, and you can access bytes at anyposition in the block.**
- Character type behaves like a flow of characters. You can read and write characters, but you can't seek to a given position and change arbitrary bytes.
- To find out the type of a given device file, use **ls -l** command. **b** or **c** character is appear as the first letter in the output.

### Rights Management
- **chown user file** changes the owner of the file.
- **chgrp group file** alters the owner group.
- **chmod rights file** changes the permissions for the file.
- **-R** option to operate recursively in sub-directories. This is forchanging rights for an entire file tree.

### Getting System Information and Logs
- **id** command displays the identity of the user running the session along with the list of groups they belong to. Since access to  some files or devices may be limited to groupmembers, checking available group membership may be useful.
- **uname -a** command returns a single line documenting the kernel name, the hostname, the kernel release and other information. The output of this command should usually be included in bug reports.
- **free** displays information about memory.
- **journalctl** displays all logs that you can use.

### Discovering the Hardware
- Kernel exports many details about detected hardware through the **/proc/** and **/sys/** virtual filesystems.
- **lspci** and **lsusb** lists USB devices, and **lspcmcia** lists PCMCIA cards.
- **lsshw** program displays a long description of the hardware discovered in a hierarchical manner. Should attach its full output to any report about hardware support problems.

### Summary
- Traditionally, application configuration files are stored under your home directory, in hidden files or directories starting with a period (or dot).

## RTFM (read the F***ng manual) <- the most important thing for me..

The following article is good when I ask someone.

## Cheat seat

- **/etc/ssh/sshd_config**
-> setting for ssh service.

- **/etc/ssh/ssh_host_***
-> stores **SSH host keys**
